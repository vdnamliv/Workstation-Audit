# VT-AUDIT Nginx Gateway Configuration
# Copy this file to .env if you need custom variables

# Note: Nginx gateway primarily uses configuration files in conf/ directory
# No environment variables required for basic operation
# 
# SSL certificates should be placed in certs/ directory:
# - certs/server.crt
# - certs/server.key
# - certs/stepca_chain.crt (for mTLS agent verification)
#
# Production configuration:
# 1. Replace self-signed certificates with proper SSL certs
# 2. Update conf/conf.d/00-upstream.conf with production IPs
# 3. Uncomment mTLS directives in conf/conf.d/20-agent-mtls-443.conf
